# anr-talent-discovery
A&amp;R Talent Discovery Model using Python, SQL &amp; Tableau
Trigger: The workflow runs when there is a push or pull request to the main branch.
## 1 Jobs:
install_dependencies: Installs the required Python dependencies from requirements.txt.
run_tests: Runs unit tests using pytest.
train_model: Trains the model by running main.py.
upload_results: Uploads the trained model results (e.g., to cloud storage like AWS S3).
1.3 Configure Environment Variables
If you’re uploading model results (e.g., to AWS), ensure you configure necessary environment variables such as AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in your repository settings:

### Go to Settings → Secrets.
Add secrets such as AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
#### 1.4 Customize Your Workflow
Adjust the steps in the YAML file as needed:

## 2 Modify the Python version to match the version you're using.
Change main.py and other script names to match the file paths of your model and test code.
Customize the upload section to suit the platform where you’re uploading the results (e.g., Google Cloud Storage, Azure, or FTP server).
2. Test the Workflow
Once you've created the main.yml file and pushed it to GitHub, you can test the workflow:

##  Push changes to the main branch.
Go to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository to see the workflow run.
Monitor the logs to ensure each step completes successfully.
## 3. View Results and Logs
GitHub Actions provides detailed logs for each step. You can view the output of each job by selecting the workflow run under the Actions tab.

## 4. Debugging
If any step fails:

Check the detailed error message in the logs.
Ensure that the dependencies in requirements.txt are correctly listed.
Double-check your model training script for potential errors.
If you’re uploading results to a remote server, ensure the credentials and paths are correct.
Conclusion
With GitHub Actions, you can automate the entire process of testing, training, and uploading your A&R Talent Discovery Model. This ensures a streamlined and repeatable pipeline for continuous integration and delivery.
